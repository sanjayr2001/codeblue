### SOFTWARE : ANDROID STUDIO 
### FRONT END DESIGN : GOOGLE MATERIAL DESIGN
### DATABASE : GOOGLE FIREBASE REALTIME DATABASE

## Abstract
Nowadays, smartphones have reached every hand and every home. As a result, people are making use of the beneficial mobile applications to make their everyday life easier. Code Blue is an application that helps people of all age to keep track of their medical related data like prescription, health related tests and their results, medical history and so on. Our main target is to help the elderly people to take medicines on time. Hospitals can also be integrated to our application so that the doctors can directly provide prescription through the app. We have developed various modules to implement the above functionalities in our app. The problem with the existing systems is that all these functionalites come as addition functionalities to a teleconsultation done with other apps, there is no specific app designed just for reminder functionality. Code Blue was designed for the appropriate medication administration including time and dosages through: recording patient and medication data; scheduling patientsâ€™medication; and reporting medication administration on progress.
